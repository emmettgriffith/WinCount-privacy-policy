# Privacy Policy

**WinCount** — Last updated: February 7, 2026

## Overview

WinCount is a personal win-tracking app built with your privacy as a priority. We believe your data belongs to you and only you.

## Data Collection

**WinCount does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.** All information you enter into the app stays entirely on your device.

## What We Store

The app stores the following data locally on your device:

- Your win entries (timestamps only)

This data is stored using Apple's SwiftData framework and is saved only to your device's local storage. It is never sent to any server, cloud service, or third party.

## No Analytics or Tracking

WinCount does not use any analytics services, tracking pixels, advertising identifiers, or crash reporting tools. We have no way to see how you use the app.

## No Network Access

WinCount does not connect to the internet. The app functions entirely offline and makes no network requests of any kind.

## No Third-Party Services

WinCount does not integrate with any third-party SDKs, services, or APIs.

## Data Deletion

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you can delete all WinCount data at any time by deleting the app. No data will remain on any server because no data was ever sent to one.

## Children's Privacy

WinCount does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. The app collects no data whatsoever.

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever update this privacy policy, the changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date. Given the nature of the app, we do not anticipate any changes.
